# Fromage
**Fromage** is a high level dynamically typed programming language compiled via a **C** compiler with custom memory management.
For maximum Fromage complience, the whole language, including the compiler, is written in French.

It runs inside a custom built virtual machine, thus can be used on any platform **C** can be compiled into.

Is is heavily inspired by **Lox**, and was made in fact during learning how to [Craft Interpreters](https://craftinginterpreters.com/) by Robert Nystrom.

The specs are very similar to the Lox and thus for comprehensive guide, for now, you can use the [Lox Language Specification](https://craftinginterpreters.com/the-lox-language.html).
