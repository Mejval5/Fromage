        <b>Fromage</b> is a high level dynamically typed programming language compiled via a <b>C</b> compiler with custom memory management.
        For maximum Fromage complience, the whole language, including the compiler, is written in French.<br><br>
        It runs inside a custom built virtual machine, thus can be used on any platform <b>C</b> can be compiled into.
        Is is heavily inspired by <b>Lox</b>, and was made in fact during my learning of <a href="https://craftinginterpreters.com/">Crafting Interpreters</a> by Robert Nystrom.<br><br>
        The specs are very similar to the Lox and thus for comprehensive guide, for now, you can use the <a href="https://craftinginterpreters.com/the-lox-language.html">Lox Language Specification</a>.
